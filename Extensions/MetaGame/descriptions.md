# MG Plugin (MetaGame)

**MG (MetaGame)** is a plugin that allows you to easily add various meta-game elements to an existing game with core mechanics at your discretion.

With MG, you can implement features such as:  
- Daily rewards  
- Progression through a battle pass  
- Events and promotions  
- And much more  

For convenient handling of meta-elements, the plugin includes a currency creation and management system. This makes it easy to integrate in-game resources needed to interact with the meta-game.

MG helps expand the gaming experience and increase player engagement by adding flexible and customizable mechanics on top of the core game.
